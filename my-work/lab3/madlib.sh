echo "It was a Sunday afternoon. My piano was complaining how he's sad he's the only piano that doesn't know $NOUN1.
He was about to $NOUN2 because I hushed him as I heard $NOUN3 calling my name downstairs.
She's my piano teacher and she liked $NOUN4, which was intimidating.
$NOUN5, I hid under the $NOUN6 and booked a flight to $NOUN7 to skip the class.
Then I heard my piano singing $NOUN8, my least favorite song. That's when I noticed I was in a dream."
